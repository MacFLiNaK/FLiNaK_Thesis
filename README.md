# FLiNaK_Thesis
This repository contains a list of successful and complete (temperature range from 873 K to 1300 K) computations. 
The first step of my project is to create a FLiNaK model that will then undergo proton and neutron irradiation. I used CP2K as quantum package to perform AIMD in an NPT environment. The initial cell size was determined based on previous computational and experimental studies.
